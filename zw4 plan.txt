alright guys so heres the plan for zombiewars 4

same core shooter concept

Graphics:
- better graphics in general
- more landscape features
- no shadows for now?
- animations and stuff
- high-res textures

Mechanics:
- same core shooter concept
- collect resources from:
  - zombie drops
  - ground loot
  - trees and rocc
- make towers and place towers to defend the shawarma
- also you can dye towers and make skins for them and there are building blocks so you can play mc as well

Dimensions:
- you start in an earthlike dimension called "ground 1"
  - the only zombies spawning there are the regular ones that can meelee and the repeercs that blow up when damaged
  - sometimes there will be bosses but not really
  - only place you can build
- there is a blank dimension called "unground 1"
  - you can't see nothing and there is only a gridded floor
  - zombies are just distortions in the gridded floor and if you kill them you get armor-related items to upgrade your tower armor
- there is also a parkour dimension called "noground 1"
  - the zombies there can fly and just hover around you but you cannot fly
  - killing them results in very powerful drops but only if you can prevent them from falling into the void
  - drops include powerful powerups, potions, and good weapons
- lastly there is a nether-like dimension called "hotground 1"
  - yea so zombies that shoot fire and you get fire related items like flamethrowers and bombs
- and also a secret dimension called "jerryground 69" where the ground is made of jerry
  - the clouds are jerry
  - the zombies are also jerry
  - you get the apple-juice related items

Guns and items:
- for guns just port over from zombiewars 3 and get someone to do 3d modeling
- resources: wood, rocc, distilled water, iron, silicon, cobalt-60
-
