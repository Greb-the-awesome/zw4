# Zombiewars Changelog

# Version 0.1:
*Jul 23, 2024*

**Major League Game Development presents...**
## ZOMBIEWARS 4 BETA 0.1
## https://zombiewars.net/
The ~~forgotten~~ long-awaited Zombiewars 4 is finally here!

This is a huge step up and not even comparable to the old, janky, 40fps zombiewars 3.

We got a __proper map__, __skybox__, zombies with __pathfinding __capability, a very scary "HELP" scratched on the cave walls of the custom map, __parkour__, __physics__, and __*so much more*__!

**The core mechanics are the same: zombie = shoot at zombie**

This game is in beta and a lot of features like weapon drops, or even different levels, or a finish game system, have not been added, but you can see the core.

**Give it a try (please i spent so long on this)**

More updates soon:tm:

small zombiewars update

that took way too long

zombies shoot in random bursts instead of periodically (more fun and deadly)

muzzle flash! so guns look a bit better

# Version 0.5
*Aug 30, 2024*

@zombiewars 
## Massive Zombiewars VFX + SFX update
*Beta v0.5*

so yeah i decided that zombiewars didn't look good enough and neither did it sound good enough so I added a bunch of VFX and SFX
### VFX:
- **Darker lighting** so it looks more spooky
    - Changed the skybox to make it darker too
- **Muzzle flash** now works properly
    - Made muzzle flash full bright
    - Made muzzle flash light up the surroundings too
- **Cartridge ejection** so your gun looks better
- **Ambient particles** to make it look more dynamic and alive
- **GUI effects**
    - Better crosshair
    - Hit marker appearing when you hit a zombie
        - Also numbers appear to tell you how much damage you did
    - Red arrow appearing to tell you which direction damage came from when you take damage
- **Zombie death particles** to make it look like the zombie exploded when it died
### SFX:
- **Zombie aggro noises** (revamped zombie aggro noises)
- **Ambient sound** of dripping water and a random chord progression in the background

Also, I made **heavy optimizations** to the game so it runs blazing fast

# Version 0.6
*Sep 25, 2024*

@zombiewars 
## Zombiewars update
-# beta v0.6
- **Better menu screen** so it looks more profesisonal and nice
  - Nice colors and finally a nice banner
- **Minor balancing changes**
  - Zombies have much reduced probability to go through walls (but since my physics engine is bad, there is still a very small chance of that happening)
  - Zombie speed nerfed from 8m/s to 7m/s, react with :glenn_tf_u_say: if you want it nerfed even more
- **Death screen** (finally) instead of the game just blanking out when you die
  - Death music plays (isolated guitar of "under pressure" by Queen) because I get to choose the music and Queen is the best band
- **Stats** (zombies killed and time survived) mostly for game dev club's gaming competition on Friday (go to game dev club)
https://zombiewars.net/
overall not that big but still it's nice ig

Update notes on the actual website:
**A New Look**
We got a new homepage (finally) that looks better i guess? Also, we fixed the bug where zombies could go outside the walls (finally). Now if you die, you can only blame your skill issue. Lastly, we nerfed the zombies' movement speed from 8m/s to 7m/s.

# Version 0.7
*Oct 5, 2024*

@zombiewars 
## Zombiewars update
-# beta v0.7
- **FINALLY added restarting the game after death** without having to reload the page
  - this was actually pretty complicated :skull:
- **New level!** A lot of you complained that the first (and previously, the only) level was too hard, so I used my extreme Blender skills to create a new and hopefully easier level from the lessons I learned.
  - This is the level which was prominently featured in the trailer.
- **Teleporters** at the end of the level which will teleport you to the next level
  - wow we actually have different levels now instead of just one map
- **Credits map** (i.e level 3)
  - The credits music is actually pretty nice if I say so myself, so beat the game and have a listen!
    - It may be impossible to beat the game though because of a potential bug but shhhh
This update took me a long time because some of the stuff like loading new levels is actually kinda hard to implement and had a lot of bugs.
https://zombiewars.net/ yippeee go play the game
On a side note, I made a **Zombiewars OST** compilation! This was really just random songs I made cause I didn't want to do math, and hardly any of them are actually used in the game currently --> https://youtu.be/toUjYV5lJmM

*I forgot to add update notes on the website :skull:*

# Version 0.8
*Oct 31, 2024*

## Zombiewars update lesgo
-# beta v0.8
Tired of the same two guns with the same firing and reloading sounds? Well, you'll love this update, introducing four new guns! These guns can be found as loot randomly scattered across the map.

First up is the humble **AK-47**. A classic, this weapon is balanced in many aspects and offers a nice upgrade to the MP40.

If you're not satisfied with its 30 round magazine, fear not as the **PK **boasts an incredible 100-round magazine for a never-ending barrage of bullets. You'll want a secondary though, because of its low accuracy and long reload.

Not a spray and pray? If you think you're the one with laser aim, maybe the **AN-94**, with its quick two-round hyperburst, will be your friend.

Or if you want even more damage, try out the **Mosin-Nagant**. Place your shots carefully and you will be unbeatable (hopefully).

also we:
- overhauled weapon firing sounds (took me so long)
- added ability to reload weapons with R
- made muzzle flash smaller
- added right click scope
- fixed a bunch of bugs
- made altitude damage faster

**Heavy Fire**

Tired of the same two guns with the same firing and reloading sounds? Well, you'll love this update! Major League Game Development proudly presents four new guns to satisfy your desire for fire! These guns can be found as loot randomly scattered across the map.

First up is the humble AK-47. A classic, this weapon is balanced in many aspects and offers a nice upgrade to the MP40.

If you're not satisfied with it's 30 round magazine, fear not as the PK boasts an incredible 100-round magazine for a never-ending barrage of bullets. You'll want a secondary though, because of its low accuracy and long reload.

Or if you want even more damage, try out the Mosin-Nagant. Place your shots carefully and you will be unbeatable (hopefully).

That's not all! We've completely overhauled the weapon firing and reloading sounds. No more MP40s that sound like a cereal box. Experience the sounds for yourself and feel the power!

Yeah we have even more. Now you can reload your weapon with R instead of having to shoot all of your rounds, you can use your weapon sights with right click, we fixed a bunch of bugs, and made the muzzle flash smaller.

# Version 0.9

@zombiewars 
## Zombiewars update
### Beta v0.9 - World of Sound
The game springs to life with our wonderful new additions of SFX!

OK I'm done using figurative language.

Basically we added a bunch of SFX for:

- walking and jumping
- zombie deaths
- player taking damage
- zombie taking damage
- (my favorite) bullet whooshing

Also we added **lore recordings**! You can find them scattered around the first level.

A bunch of other little goodies: (tried to) fix audio delayed playing issue, made textures load better so you see the blue "unloaded" texture less, fixed gun muzzle flash not showing, made items not collide with the player, populated the second level with items.
