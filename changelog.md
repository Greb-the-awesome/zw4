# Zombiewars Changelog

# Version 0.1:

**Major League Game Development presents...**
## ZOMBIEWARS 4 BETA 0.1
## https://zombiewars.net/
The ~~forgotten~~ long-awaited Zombiewars 4 is finally here!

This is a huge step up and not even comparable to the old, janky, 40fps zombiewars 3.

We got a __proper map__, __skybox__, zombies with __pathfinding __capability, a very scary "HELP" scratched on the cave walls of the custom map, __parkour__, __physics__, and __*so much more*__!

**The core mechanics are the same: zombie = shoot at zombie**

This game is in beta and a lot of features like weapon drops, or even different levels, or a finish game system, have not been added, but you can see the core.

**Give it a try (please i spent so long on this)**

More updates soon:tm:

# Version 0.4:

small zombiewars update

that took way too long

https://zombiewars.net/

zombies now only shoot when they have line of sight (the raycasting required to detect this took me literally 2 days)

zombies shoot in random bursts instead of periodically (more fun and deadly)

muzzle flash! so guns look a bit better

# Version 0.5

@zombiewars 
## Massive Zombiewars VFX + SFX update
*Beta v0.5*

so yeah i decided that zombiewars didn't look good enough and neither did it sound good enough so I added a bunch of VFX and SFX
### VFX:
- **Darker lighting** so it looks more spooky
    - Changed the skybox to make it darker too
- **Muzzle flash** now works properly
    - Made muzzle flash full bright
    - Made muzzle flash light up the surroundings too
- **Cartridge ejection** so your gun looks better
- **Ambient particles** to make it look more dynamic and alive
- **GUI effects**
    - Better crosshair
    - Hit marker appearing when you hit a zombie
        - Also numbers appear to tell you how much damage you did
    - Red arrow appearing to tell you which direction damage came from when you take damage
- **Zombie death particles** to make it look like the zombie exploded when it died
### SFX:
- **Zombie aggro noises** (revamped zombie aggro noises)
- **Ambient sound** of dripping water and a random chord progression in the background

Also, I made **heavy optimizations** to the game so it runs blazing fast
