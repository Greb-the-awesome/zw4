# Zombiewars Changelog

# Version 0.1:

**Major League Game Development presents...**
## ZOMBIEWARS 4 BETA 0.1
## https://zombiewars.net/
The ~~forgotten~~ long-awaited Zombiewars 4 is finally here!

This is a huge step up and not even comparable to the old, janky, 40fps zombiewars 3.

We got a __proper map__, __skybox__, zombies with __pathfinding __capability, a very scary "HELP" scratched on the cave walls of the custom map, __parkour__, __physics__, and __*so much more*__!

**The core mechanics are the same: zombie = shoot at zombie**

This game is in beta and a lot of features like weapon drops, or even different levels, or a finish game system, have not been added, but you can see the core.

**Give it a try (please i spent so long on this)**

More updates soon:tm:

# Version 0.4:

small zombiewars update

that took way too long

https://zombiewars.net/

zombies now only shoot when they have line of sight (the raycasting required to detect this took me literally 2 days)

zombies shoot in random bursts instead of periodically (more fun and deadly)

muzzle flash! so guns look a bit better

# Version 0.5

@zombiewars 
## Massive Zombiewars VFX + SFX update
*Beta v0.5*

so yeah i decided that zombiewars didn't look good enough and neither did it sound good enough so I added a bunch of VFX and SFX
### VFX:
- **Darker lighting** so it looks more spooky
    - Changed the skybox to make it darker too
- **Muzzle flash** now works properly
    - Made muzzle flash full bright
    - Made muzzle flash light up the surroundings too
- **Cartridge ejection** so your gun looks better
- **Ambient particles** to make it look more dynamic and alive
- **GUI effects**
    - Better crosshair
    - Hit marker appearing when you hit a zombie
        - Also numbers appear to tell you how much damage you did
    - Red arrow appearing to tell you which direction damage came from when you take damage
- **Zombie death particles** to make it look like the zombie exploded when it died
### SFX:
- **Zombie aggro noises** (revamped zombie aggro noises)
- **Ambient sound** of dripping water and a random chord progression in the background

Also, I made **heavy optimizations** to the game so it runs blazing fast

# Version 0.6
@zombiewars 
## Zombiewars update
-# beta v0.6
- **Better menu screen** so it looks more profesisonal and nice
  - Nice colors and finally a nice banner
- **Minor balancing changes**
  - Zombies have much reduced probability to go through walls (but since my physics engine is bad, there is still a very small chance of that happening)
  - Zombie speed nerfed from 8m/s to 7m/s, react with :glenn_tf_u_say: if you want it nerfed even more
- **Death screen** (finally) instead of the game just blanking out when you die
  - Death music plays (isolated guitar of "under pressure" by Queen) because I get to choose the music and Queen is the best band
- **Stats** (zombies killed and time survived) mostly for game dev club's gaming competition on Friday (go to game dev club)
https://zombiewars.net/
overall not that big but still it's nice ig

Update notes on the actual website:
**A New Look**
We got a new homepage (finally) that looks better i guess? Also, we fixed the bug where zombies could go outside the walls (finally). Now if you die, you can only blame your skill issue. Lastly, we nerfed the zombies' movement speed from 8m/s to 7m/s.
